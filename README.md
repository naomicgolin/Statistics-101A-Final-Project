# Stats_101A
This is a repository that contains my final project for Statistics 101A. I took the class during the Winter 2021 quarter and scored an A in both the class and project

The purpose of this project was to develop a predictive model that would best predict the price of a car. The model was used in a class Kaggle competition and was judged based on its R^2 value when implemented on a test dataset.
